# Hypergraph Partitioning Experimental Results for our SEA 20 paper (https://drops.dagstuhl.de/opus/volltexte/2020/12085/pdf/LIPIcs-SEA-2020-11.pdf)

Only connectivity metric

KaHyPar is only used in direct k-way mode.

Timelimit: 8 hours

A few runs are missing due to some weird filesystem issues on the cluster, but we should have at least 8 out of the 10 seeds completed for each instance, and it's only instances that timed out anyways.

Machine used:
Old BWUniCluster
Intel Xeon E5-2670, Sandy Bridge, 2.6 GHz, 2x8 cores, 64 GB RAM, 20MB L3 Cache, 8x256KB L2 Cache.
All runs are 1 core out of the 16 cores of a node.
g++ 9.2
